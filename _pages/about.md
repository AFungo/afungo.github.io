About me
======

I'm Augusto Fungo, a Computer Science graduate from the National University of Río Cuarto, Argentina. In my academic journey, I’ve actively combined theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience.

My portfolio includes a financial management system, a distributed flight ticketing service in Python using gRPC, and a co-working space reservation platform built with modern web technologies.

Beyond coding, I’m get involve in software testing, automation, and clean software design — areas I explored in my final degree project and by attending specialized courses and conferences like ECI and CACIC.

I’m currently seeking opportunities to kick-start my professional career in software development, where I can continue learning, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow as part of a team.
